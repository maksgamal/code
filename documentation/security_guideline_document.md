# Security Guideline Document for LeadFuel

This document defines the security principles, controls, and best practices to be applied throughout the design, development, testing, and operation of the LeadFuel B2B lead-generation SaaS platform. It aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

## 1. Security by Design

• Embed security requirements into every phase of the project lifecycle—from planning and architecture to coding, testing, and deployment.\
• Conduct regular threat modeling workshops focused on core flows: authentication/onboarding, credit-based unlocking, list management, billing, and team sharing.\
• Establish a Security Champions program within the engineering team to review pull requests for security concerns.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1 Robust Authentication

• Use Supabase Auth (or Clerk) with strong password policies: 12+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols.\
• Store passwords with a memory-hard hashing algorithm (Argon2id or bcrypt) and per-user salt.\
• Enforce email verification before granting access to authenticated endpoints.

### 2.2 Session Management & JWT

• Issue signed JWTs (avoid `alg=none`) with short lifetimes and rotation via refresh tokens.\
• Store JWTs in secure, httpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies.\
• Invalidate sessions on logout and enforce absolute and idle timeouts.

### 2.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

• Provide optional MFA via TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator) for Admin and high-privilege accounts.

### 2.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

• Define two roles: **Organization Admin** and **Member**.\
• Enforce server-side checks (via Supabase RLS policies) on every sensitive operation: list sharing, credit allocation, billing access, transaction log viewing.\
• Deny by default; explicitly grant permissions per role and per resource.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

• Treat all external input (API calls, query params, form fields) as untrusted.\
• Enforce strict schema validation using Zod/TypeScript on frontend and backend.\
• Use parameterized queries or Supabase client libraries to prevent SQL injection.\
• Sanitize and encode any data rendered in the browser to prevent XSS.\
• Validate redirect targets against an allow-list to prevent open redirects.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

### 4.1 Encryption

• Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all services (frontend, API, database connections).\
• Ensure Supabase’s at-rest encryption (AES-256) is enabled for Postgres storage and file storage.

### 4.2 Secrets Management

• Do not hard-code API keys, database URLs, or Stripe secrets.\
• Store all secrets in environment variables or a dedicated vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).\
• Rotate keys periodically and on suspected compromise.

### 4.3 Sensitive Data Handling

• Gated fields (email, phone) are accessible only after credit deduction and must be masked or omitted from logs.\
• Implement data-subject workflows: consent capture, export (DSAR), deletion requests per GDPR/CCPA.\
• Log only minimal metadata for transactions (e.g., transaction ID, user ID, timestamp) — avoid logging PII itself.

## 5. API & Service Security

• Expose all endpoints over HTTPS with HSTS enabled.\
• Implement rate limiting and throttling on key endpoints (search, unlock) to prevent abuse and DoS.\
• Restrict CORS to trusted origins (your production domain and relevant staging).\
• Validate and sanitize JSON bodies against strict schemas.\
• Use correct HTTP verbs: GET for reads, POST for state changes (unlock, list-create), PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removals.

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

• Enable anti-CSRF tokens (same-site cookies or synchronizer tokens) on all state-changing requests.\
• Configure security headers:\
– Content-Security-Policy (restrict scripts, disallow inline JS)\
– X-Frame-Options: DENY\
– X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\
– Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\
– Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

• Secure cookies: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.\
• Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage.\
• Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) on any third-party scripts.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

### 7.1 Server & Hosting

• Harden Vercel and Supabase managed instances: disable unused features, set up IP allow-lists for admin portals.\
• Enforce minimal network exposure: only necessary ports (443).\
• Apply the principle of least privilege to any service roles or service accounts.

### 7.2 Configuration & Secrets

• Store environment-specific configurations in secure vaults or CI/CD secrets stores.\
• Do not commit `.env` or `*.local` files to source control.

### 7.3 Updates & Patching

• Subscribe to vulnerability feeds for Next.js, React, Supabase client, Stripe SDK, Python libraries.\
• Apply security patches within 48 hours of release.

### 7.4 Debug & Diagnostics

• Disable debug and verbose logging in production.\
• Protect any diagnostic or health-check endpoints behind authentication.

## 8. Dependency Management

• Maintain lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `Pipfile.lock`) for reproducible builds.\
• Vet all third-party NPM and Python packages for known vulnerabilities via automated SCA tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).\
• Minimize direct dependencies; remove unused modules.\
• Regularly audit and update dependencies to patched versions.

## 9. Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response

• Centralize logs (e.g., Supabase logs, Vercel logs, Edge Function logs) into a secure SIEM.\
• Monitor suspicious activities: repeated failed logins, rapid credit unlock attempts, RLS policy failures.\
• Retain audit logs for at least 90 days.\
• Define an incident response plan: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-mortem.

## 10. Error Handling & Fail-Secure Principles

• Return generic error messages to users; avoid exposing stack traces or internal identifiers.\
• Validate all external responses (e.g., Stripe webhooks, enrichment API responses) before processing.\
• In case of downstream failures (ETL pipelines, enrichment APIs), degrade functionality gracefully with clear user messaging and retry mechanisms.

## 11. Compliance Controls

• Implement explicit opt-in consent flows for data collection and enrichment per GDPR.\
• Provide users with self-service portals to download or delete their data.\
• Ensure CAN-SPAM compliance on all outbound emails (unsubscribe links, accurate sender info).

### Conclusion

By following these guidelines, LeadFuel will maintain a robust security posture, protect sensitive user data, and comply with relevant privacy regulations. Security implementation should be reviewed in each sprint, and any deviations or new risks must be documented and remediated promptly.
